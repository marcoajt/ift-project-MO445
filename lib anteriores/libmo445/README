This is the library of functions that you will use to implement tasks
in C. In the folder examples, you will find C programs that exemplify
the use of this library. The programs can be compiled by typing make
<basename>. For example, to compile adjacency.c, type make
adjacency. However, you will need to install some packages:

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libz-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential

In the folder include, you will find definitions of the functions and
data structures. You can always ask me for help about how to use a
given function or if the library contains a function to perform a
given task.

The binary files are written in the folder bin.

The folder data contains adjacency files (txt) and images for the
examples.
